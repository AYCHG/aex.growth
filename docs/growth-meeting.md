### Review and question learnings
_(First ~30 minutes)_

At the meeting we run down the list of learnings collected over the last week by all participants. The owner of each learning presents the learning as concisely as they can to get it out of their silo and spread it accross the team.

The rest of the meeting participants is expected to ask questions and challenge the learning in three areas:

**1. Is this a valid learning?**

Questioning validity helps prevent false learnings. Participants ask questions on the reasoning and basis of this learning. How did the owner came to the conclusion? How did the owner make sure, that this assumptions are valid?

**2. What else might this tell us?**

A lot of times other participants will have different views on data or compelling follow-up questions that are worth finding the answers to. Asking this question helps the participants dig deeper and extract more out of a learning.

**3. How can we apply this learning?**

As a group we try to think about where else within the app, website, forum,... we can apply a learning. This amplifies the impact of the learning. For example, a liquidity experiment may yield a learning that a specific distance and amount helps an offer to get taken quickly. This learning could be applied within the app, by suggesting configurations for offers if the user wants to quickly buy/sell and it could also be applied by showing a matrix of offer configurations on the website that have low fees and high chances to be taken quickly.

The goal of these three questions areas is to raise our game and extract the most that we can out of each learning.

### Review any metrics/questions
_(Last 5-10 minutes)_

How can we improve the measurement of this kind of experiments?
Do we have enough data to verify/falsify our assumptions?
How do we progress from here on?
