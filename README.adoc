Issues capturing ideas and experiments designed to grow Bisq.

See the `#growthhacking` channel in https://bisq.network/slack-invite[Slack].

Following structure is strongly inspired by Brian Balfour, Sean Ellis and many others.

# Goals of our Growth Process

- **Learning**
+
Constant learning of our customer, product, channels and feeding that learning into the process to improve.
- **Rhythm**
+
 Momentum is powerful. Establish a cadence to fight through failures, get to successes, and find momentum
- **Autonomy**
+
 Individuals decide what they work on to achieve the OKR’s (Objectives and Key Results)
- **Accountability**
+
With autonomy, comes accountability. You don’t have to be right all the time, but there is an expectation to improve to be eligible for compensation.

# Zoom Out Phase
Happens roughly (every ~2-3 month).

## Finding Levers
Goal is to find the **highest impact area** that we can **focus on right now** given limited resources.

**Evaluate**
To evaluate each goal we should think about following key points:

1. Baseline
2. Ceiling
3. Sensitivity Over Time

## Set Goals/OKRs (Objective and Key Results)

### OKR Principles

1. Inputs not outputs 
OKR’s will never be set on the output they will always be set on the inputs.
2. In our face
 OKR’s will be somewhere that we can’t forget them. Review daily and weekly.
3. Concrete
 Goals will change mid-OKR VERY rarely.

**Objective:**

Define qualitative statement::
+
e.g. „Make Virality a Meaningful Channel“
+
KR1: "1.5% Viral/Weekly Active User"
+
KR2: "2% Viral/Weekly Active User
+
KR3: "3% Viral/Weekly Active User

**Timeframe:**
30-90 Days

## Explore Data
Qualitative, Quantitative and Intuition

1. Qualitative 
+
User Surveys, 1 on 1 Conversations, Full Story Videos, Customer Support Tickets
2. Quantitative
+
 Google Analytics, Market API and other data sources we can access. Goal is to answer questions we don’t know about our user, product, or channel. Break it into pieces.

*Find always new ways how to collect input from our customers without violating their right for privacy.*

# Continuous Weekly/Daily Process

## 1. Brainstorm
Never stop putting new ideas into our https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea[Backlog]!

### Inputs not Outputs
Focus on input not on the output parameters

1. Observe 
How are other doing it? Look outside of your immediate product space. Walk through together.
2. Question 
Question brainstorming. Why? What is… What if… What about… How do we do more of…
3. Associate
 Connect the dots between unrelated things. I.e What if our activation process was like closing a deal?

## 2. Prioritize
(Experiment issues in https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea[Backlog])

Prioritize considering following key parameters:

1. Probability
+
 *Low* -20%, *Medium* - 50% or *High* - 80%
2. Impact 
+
Comes from your prediction. Take into account long lasting effects vs one hit wonders. 

Creating a Hypothesis:

> If successful, *[VARIABLE]* will increase by *[IMPACT]*, because *[ASSUMPTIONS]*.

** Look at:**


1. Quantitative
+
(Previous Experiments, Surrounding Data, Funnel Data )

2. Qualitative
+
(Surveys, Support Emails, User Testing Recordings )

3. Secondary
+
(Networking, Blogs, Competitor Observation, Case Studies  )

**Create Experiment Issue**
See https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md[issue template] for guidance and inspiration.

## 3. Test
What do we really need to do to test our assumption?

Setting up a **Minimal Viable Test**

1. Efficiency 
+
What is the least resource intensive way to gather data about the hypothesis?
2. Validity
+
 The experiment must take into account how to get a valid result by designing a control and required amount of data.

## 4. Implement
Get Shit Done.

## 5. Analyse

1. Success/Fail
+
 Be prepared for a lot of failures.
2. Impact 
+
How close have you been to your prediction?
3. Why? 
+
The most important question you can ask. Why did you see the result that you did?  

Update and close the issue as soon as you've finished analyzation.

## 6. Systemize
This is all about how we could systemize our approach in growth.

1. Productize 
+
Productize as much as you can with technology and engineering.
2. Playbooks 
+
For the things you can’t productize, build into step by step playbooks to make them repeatable.
